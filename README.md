## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

## Invoice Management System  I have developed a software application for managing invoices. This program allows you to create and export invoices in Excel format, generate printable reports, archive invoices, edit them, delete invoices, and change their payment status from unpaid to paid or partially paid. Additionally, you can print invoices and access customer reports.  The program features a robust search functionality, enabling you to search for invoices based on criteria such as department, product, and date range. You can also search for invoices by invoice type or invoice number.  Within the user management section, there is a comprehensive user list with options to enable or disable users (preventing or allowing login). Moreover, user permissions can be customized, allowing you to add, delete, or modify permissions for each user.  The invoice software supports multiple languages, including Arabic and English. It includes a notification system that alerts users when a new invoice is added, providing quick access to invoice details and the option to send an email containing the invoice.  Additionally, the program offers graphical representation of invoice data, and it supports file uploads in PDF, JPEG, PNG, and JPG formats.  ## Features  - Create and manage invoices efficiently. - Export invoices to Excel format. - Generate printable reports. - Archive and edit invoices. - Update invoice payment status. - Search for invoices by department, product, and date range. - Search invoices by type or invoice number. - User management with enable/disable functionality. - Customizable user permissions. - Multi-language support (Arabic and English). - Notification system for new invoice additions. - Graphical representation of invoice data. - File upload support for PDF, JPEG, PNG, and JPG formats.  ## Requirements  * PHP Laravel * CSS, HTML, JavaScript, jQuery * Bootstrap * MySQL * Laravel Excel for Excel export * Spatie Permission for user permissions * Fxcosta library for graphical invoices * Laravel Localization for translation  ## Installation and Usage  For detailed installation and usage instructions, please look below steps * download Or clone project * Go to the folder application usin cd commend * Run (composer install) on your terminal * Run (copy .env.example .env) * Run (php artisan key:generatore) * Run (php artisan serve)  ## Dependencies  - PHP Laravel - CSS, HTML, JavaScript, jQuery - Bootstrap - MySQL - Laravel Excel - Spatie Permission - Fxcosta library - Laravel Localization  ## Contact  - For any inquiries or feedback, please feel free to contact us at ahmed.abdellah664@gmail.com
