## Invoice Management System

I have developed a software application for managing invoices. This program allows you to create and export invoices in Excel format, generate printable reports, archive invoices, edit them, delete invoices, and change their payment status from unpaid to paid or partially paid. Additionally, you can print invoices and access customer reports.

The program features a robust search functionality, enabling you to search for invoices based on criteria such as department, product, and date range. You can also search for invoices by invoice type or invoice number.

Within the user management section, there is a comprehensive user list with options to enable or disable users (preventing or allowing login). Moreover, user permissions can be customized, allowing you to add, delete, or modify permissions for each user.

The invoice software supports multiple languages, including Arabic and English. It includes a notification system that alerts users when a new invoice is added, providing quick access to invoice details and the option to send an email containing the invoice.

Additionally, the program offers graphical representation of invoice data, and it supports file uploads in PDF, JPEG, PNG, and JPG formats.
